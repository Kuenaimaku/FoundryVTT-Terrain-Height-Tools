# Terrain Height Tools

Tools for painting grid spaces with terrain heights and calculating line of sight with respect to these heights.

Designed for LANCER, _Terrain Height Tools_ takes inspiration from the way painting tiles works in the _[Political Map Overlay](https://github.com/cirrahn/foundry-polmap)_ module by cirrahn; and augments it with some line of sight calculation functionality and the ability to render the heights on the token layer.
